🚗 Smog Level Prediction Application

A machine learning web app to predict vehicle smog levels and raise environmental awareness.
<br>Developed as part of an Introduction to AI course.

📌 Project Overview

This application uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict smog levels based on vehicle data.
<br>It features an interactive interface built with Streamlit to make smog level assessment accessible and user-friendly.
<br>Live Demo: Streamlit App
<br>GitHub Repo: AI_Final_Project

🔍 Features

Predict smog levels from real vehicle emission data.
<br>Train and test using a Decision Tree Classifier.
<br>Fully interactive app using Streamlit.
<br>Easy to use with real-time feedback on predictions.
<br>Promotes environmental awareness and sustainability education.

📈 Dataset
We used CO2_emission.csv, which includes multiple features related to vehicle emissions, including engine size, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.
📊 Model
Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Goal: Classify vehicles into smog levels based on emission data
Output: Smog Level (e.g., Low, Moderate, High)
🌍 Motivation
Smog affects millions of lives every year. This tool aims to:
Help users understand their vehicle's environmental impact.
Encourage low-emission choices.
Promote AI's role in solving real-world environmental issues.
